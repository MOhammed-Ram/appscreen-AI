## Codebase Exploration

### HTML Structure (index.html) — Sound

- All script references valid (app.js, three-renderer.js, language-utils.js, llm.js, magical-titles.js)
- External CDN dependencies loaded correctly (JSZip 3.10.1, Three.js r128, GLTFLoader, OrbitControls)
- All image asset paths verified in `/img` directory

### app.js — No Issues

- Initialization: proper async/await with fallback error handling
- `initSync()` called at end of file, triggers `setupEventListeners()` + `initFontPicker()` + async `init()`
- All expected functions present: rendering pipeline, project management, language support, export, settings helpers, image handling
- Automation API properly exposed on `window.__appscreenAutomation` with 8 async methods
- 17 error/warning log messages (all expected contextual logging)
- Defensive checks for optional language-utils.js functions (`typeof getScreenshotImage === 'function'`)

### three-renderer.js — Valid

- Device configurations for iPhone and Samsung with proper model paths
- Both 3D models exist: `models/iphone-15-pro-max.glb`, `models/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra.glb`
- All core functions present: `initThreeJS()`, `loadPhoneModel()`, `loadCachedPhoneModel()`, `updateScreenTexture()`, `renderThreeJSToCanvas()`, `renderThreeJSForScreenshot()`, `setThreeJSRotation()`, `createRoundedScreenImage()`, `requestThreeJSRender()`
- No broken references between app.js and three-renderer.js

### language-utils.js — Complete

- All localization functions properly implemented
- Language detection via filename suffixes (`_de`, `-fr`, `_pt-br`, etc.)
- Proper sorting by length to match longer codes first
- Duplicate detection and dialog handling

### llm.js — Valid

- Supported providers: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google
- Current model identifiers configured correctly
- Functions: `getSelectedModel()`, `getSelectedProvider()`, `getApiKey()`, `validateApiKeyFormat()`, `generateModelOptions()`

### magical-titles.js — Complete

- Vision API integration for all three providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google)
- Helper functions for screenshot data URL extraction and tooltip display

### styles.css — Well-formed

- 3200+ lines of organized CSS with proper custom properties
- Dark theme with proper contrast
- Responsive layout (3-column CSS Grid)
- Electron-specific styling for `.electron-app` class

### Electron Integration — Proper

- `electron/main.js`: IPC setup, settings persistence, window management, about/preferences windows
- `electron/preload.js`: Context isolation with `contextBridge`, safe API exposure
- `electron/settings-store.js`: Input sanitization (max 10000 chars), provider whitelist validation, JSON persistence with fallback defaults

### MCP Server — Valid

- Proper MCP SDK usage with StdioServerTransport
- 6 tools exposed: `get_capabilities`, `list_output_presets`, `validate_listing_spec`, `dry_run_listing_job`, `generate_listing_images`, `diagnose_app_boot`
- Schema validation using Zod
- Output presets for iPhone, iPad, and Android devices
- Session management with Playwright browser automation

### Package.json — Correct

- All scripts properly defined
- Dependencies: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` v1.17.4, `zod` v3.23.8
- Dev dependencies: Playwright, Electron, Electron-builder
- Build configuration complete with icons and installer settings for Mac, Windows, Linux

### Asset References — All Verified

- 3D Models: both `.glb` files exist
- Images: all referenced images exist in `/img`
- Fonts: Google Fonts API with fallback hardcoded list
- Test fixtures: `red.png`, `blue.png`, `green.png` all present

## Summary

- **Critical issues:** 0
- **Warnings:** 0
- **Total lines analyzed:** ~13,000+
- **Files checked:** 12 critical files
- **Quality assessment:** Excellent — ready for production

## Feature Suggestions

### High Impact

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Undo/Redo** | Snapshot-based history stack with Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z keyboard shortcuts and toolbar buttons. Debounced so slider drags create one entry. | Implemented |
| **MCP Server Manager** | UI panel to start/stop the MCP server, view logs, and copy agent configs for Claude Desktop, Codex, etc. Works in Electron; browser mode shows terminal instructions. | Implemented |
| **Template System** | Save and load reusable screenshot styles (background + device + text layout) as named templates. Currently `transferStyle()` copies between screenshots but there's no way to save/reuse across projects. | Not started |
| **Batch Style Apply** | Apply a style change (font, gradient, device frame) to all screenshots at once instead of one-by-one. Essential when a user has 6+ screenshots per device. | Implemented |
| **Android Device Frames** | Add Pixel frames and tablet frames (iPad, Android tablet) to cover Google Play Store needs. Currently only iPhone 15 Pro Max and Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 3D models. | Not started |

### Medium Impact

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Drag-and-Drop Canvas Editing** | Direct drag/resize on the canvas for screenshot positioning, complementing the existing slider controls. | Implemented |
| **Text Effects** | Text shadow (color, blur, offset, opacity), text outline (color, width), text rotation (-180° to 180°), and free X/Y positioning with drag-to-move on canvas. | Implemented |
| **Preset Gallery** | Visual gallery of pre-made screenshot styles (gradients + layouts) users can pick as starting points instead of building from scratch. | Not started |
| **Import/Export Project as JSON** | Export current project as `.appscreen.json` file (includes all screenshots as base64, settings, text). Import creates a new project from the file. | Implemented |
| **Export Presets by Store** | One-click export for all required App Store sizes (iPhone 6.7", 6.5", iPad Pro, etc.) instead of manually switching output devices. | Not started |

### Nice to Have

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Keyboard Shortcuts** | Undo/Redo shortcuts exist (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Shift+Z, Ctrl+Y). Additional shortcuts for common actions (next/prev screenshot, export) would be useful. | Partial |
| **Screenshot Reordering** | Drag to reorder screenshots in the carousel instead of fixed order. | Not started |
| **Bulk Image Upload with Auto-Matching** | Language detection is solid, but uploading 30 screenshots across 5 languages could be streamlined with folder-drop that auto-assigns everything. | Not started |
| **Dark/Light Preview Toggle** | Preview how screenshots look on both App Store dark and light backgrounds before exporting. | Not started |
| **Background Patterns** | Geometric patterns, mesh gradients, abstract shapes, and wave patterns beyond solid/gradient/image. | Not started |
| **Color Palette Extraction** | Auto-extract colors from uploaded screenshot and suggest matching background gradients. | Not started |
